## LISTS
```js
    list1 = [10, 20, 300, 400, 5000, 6000, 500, 30, 40]

Exercise1:
    Add item 200 in the third position of list

Exercise2:
    Print number 6000 within the list
   
Exercise3:
    Replace number 20 from the list with 900
    
Exercise4:
    Add only the numbers from the following list to the end of list1. list2=[10, 40, 300, 6500]

Exercise5:
    Create a new list, named list3, having only one occurences of any element in list1.   Hint: use set() then list()
    
Exercise6:
    Sort the new list3, and print only the elements placed on even positions in the list"   Hint: use list slicing
    
Exercise7:
    list4 = ['Ana', 'are', 'mere']
    list5 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
    Print message: 'Ana 5 are 67 mere' using list indexes. Hint: Be careful for concatenation of different data types.
    
```

## DICTIONARIES
```js
    dict={"name": "John", "country": "USA", "born": 1996, "job": "Engineer", "car": "Hyundai Tucson"}


Exercise1:
    Print the year when John was born.

Exercise2:
    Change the country were John is living from 'USA' to 'CAN'.
   
Exercise3:
    dict_list = ['Jack', 'Ana', 'Dan']
    Create a new key named 'child_names' and add dict_list as value
    
Exercise4:
    Delete the job key and print just the keys from the dictionary

Exercise5:
    Having the following dict: new_dict = {"datacamp":{"Deep Learning": "Python", "Machine Learning": "Pandas"},"linkedin":"jobs","nvidia":"hardware"}
    - print value from 'Machine Learning' key.          Hint: dictionary inside another dictionary
    - add a new key 'Test' with value 'Passed' inside 'datacamp' values
    
Exercise6:
    Having the following dict: dict_list = {"datacamp":{"Deep Learning": ['Python', 'Java'], "Machine Learning": ["Pandas", "Keras"]},"linkedin":"jobs","nvidia":"hardware", "numbers": [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]}
    - Delete 'Java' value from inside the dictionary
    - Add number 6 in  the first position of 'numbers' list
    - Sort the 'numbers' list and then print the number of elements from the list
    
```

## TUPLES | SETS
```js
    tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)


Exercise1:
    Assign in one line all the elements from tuple1 to variables n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

Exercise2:
    Based on tuple1, create a new tuple2 containing elements from index 2 and 3 using list slicing
   
Exercise3:
    Is it possible to append a new element at the end of the tuple?
    
Exercise4:
    tuple3 = (5, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 10)
    Based on sets, create a new tuple named 'tuple4' without having any duplicated elements
    
```
