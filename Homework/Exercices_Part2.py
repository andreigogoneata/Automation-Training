# Exercise 1 : Print multiplication table of a given number
# Hint: You need to define a variable number = xxx, and use the range(function) range (1,11,1)
# multiply i with the given number and print the result
# For example, num = 2 so the output should be
# Expected output:
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10
# 12
# 14
# 16
# 18
# 20

# Exercise 2: Reverse the following list using for loop
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Expected output:
#
# 50
# 40
# 30
# 20
# 10

# Exercise 3: Display numbers from -10 to -1 using for loop
# Expected output:
#
# -10
# -9
# -8
# -7
# -6
# -5
# -4
# -3
# -2
# -1

# Exercise 4: Display a message “Done” after successful execution of for loop
# For example, the following loop will execute without any error.
#
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# Expected output should be:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# Done!

# Exercise 5: Display the cube of the number up to a given integer
# Given:
#
input_number = 6
#
# Expected output:
#
# Current Number is : 1  and the cube is 1
# Current Number is : 2  and the cube is 8
# Current Number is : 3  and the cube is 27
# Current Number is : 4  and the cube is 64
# Current Number is : 5  and the cube is 125
# Current Number is : 6  and the cube is 216
